# AWSIM Autonomous Research

My journey into autonomous driving development using the AWSIM simulator. This repository contains path planning systems, sensor processing, and autonomous vehicle research implementations.

## üöó What's Implemented

### Multi-Algorithm Path Planning System ‚úÖ
- **Three distinct planning algorithms**: A* (grid-based), RRT* (sampling-based), Route (lane-following)
- **Lanelet2 HD map integration** with traffic rules compliance
- **HD map processing**: lanelets with cached coordinate points
- **Live visualization** in RViz2 with path display and waypoint markers

### NDT Localization System ‚úÖ
- **Real-time vehicle positioning** using Normal Distributions Transform  
- **Centimeter-level accuracy** with pre-built map matching
- **AWSIM integration** with proper sensor transforms and timing
- **Live visualization** in RViz2 with pose tracking and fitness scores
- **Automatic initialization** from ground truth for seamless startup

### Sensor Data Processing ‚úÖ
- **Multi-sensor data logging** from AWSIM
- **Synchronized data capture** (LiDAR, cameras, IMU)
- **Real-time data analysis** and visualization
- **Point cloud filtering** and preprocessing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- ROS 2 Humble
- AWSIM simulator
- PCL library for point cloud processing

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <this-repo>
cd awsim-autonomous-research
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### Launch NDT Localization
```bash
# Start AWSIM first, then launch localization with RViz
ros2 launch awsim_localization awsim_localization.launch.py

# For custom map or parameters
ros2 launch awsim_localization awsim_localization.launch.py \
    map_path:=/path/to/your/map.pcd \
    ndt_resolution:=1.5
```

### Launch Path Planning
```bash
# Start AWSIM and localization first, then launch path planner
ros2 launch awsim_path_planner path_planner.launch.py

# Choose specific algorithm (default: route)
ros2 launch awsim_path_planner path_planner.launch.py algorithm:=astar
ros2 launch awsim_path_planner path_planner.launch.py algorithm:=rrt_star
ros2 launch awsim_path_planner path_planner.launch.py algorithm:=route
```
